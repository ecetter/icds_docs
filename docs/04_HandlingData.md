# Handling Data


Roar Collab (RC) offers many file transfer options, and these methods are described in the following sections on this page.

To comply with restricted data storage standards, Roar Restricted (RR) must adhere to a Secure Data Transfer Management Model. 
The data transfer process is described in detail in the [Roar Restricted Addendum](06_RoarRestricted.md).


## Available Filesystems and Quotas

Roar offers several file storage options for users, each with their own quotas and data retention policies. 
The multiple options are available for users to optimize their workflows.


### Storage Information


#### Roar Collab Storage

| Storage | Location | Space Quota | Files Quota | Backup Policy | Use Case |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Home | /storage/home | 16 GB | 500,000 files | Daily snapshot | Configuration files |
| Work | /storage/work | 128 GB | 1 million files | Daily snapshot | Primary user-level data |
| Scratch | /scratch | None | 1 million files | No Backup<br>Files purged after 30 days | Temporary files |
| Group | /storage/group | Specific to<br>allocation | 1 million files<br>per TB allocated | Daily snapshot | Primary shared data |

Home should primarily be used for configuration files and should not be used as a primary storage location for data. 
Work should be used as the primary personal data storage location. 
Scratch should be used for temporary files and for reading and writing large data files.

To provide a user with access to a paid group storage allocation, the owner of the storage allocation should submit a request to **icds@psu.edu** to add the user to their `<owner>_collab` group.


#### Roar Restricted Storage

| Storage | Location | Space Quota | Files Quota | Backup Policy | Use Case |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Home | /storage/home | 16 GB | 500,000 files | Daily snapshot | Configuration files |
| Work | /storage/work | 128 GB | 1 million files | Daily snapshot | Primary user-level data |
| Restricted | /storage/restricted | Specific to<br>allocation | 1 million files<br>per TB allocated | Daily snapshot | Primary shared data |

Home should primarily be used for configuration files and should not be used as a primary storage location for data. 
Work should be used as the primary personal data storage location. 
There is no scratch filesystem location available on RR.

To provide a user with access to a restricted storage allocation, the owner of the restricted storage allocation should submit a request to **icds@psu.edu** to add the user to their `<owner>_collab` group.


### Check Usage

To check storage usage against the storage quotas, run the following command on Roar:

```
$ quota_check
```

The outputs generated by these scripts are not necessarily generated in real-time, but the underlying quota information is updated several times per day. 
After removing many files, for instance, the updates to the storage usage may not be reflected in the outputs until the next update period.

For a real-time look into the memory usage for a particular storage location, navigate to the storage location and run the following command:

```
$ du -sch .[!.]* * | sort -h
```

For a real-time look into the number of files in a storage location, navigate to the storage location and run the following command:

```
$ find . -type f | wc -l
```

A user can check the storage usage of an accessible group storage location by running the following command:

```
$ df -ui <storage_location>
```


### Managing Large Configuration Files

Home is the primary location for configuration files, and many software packages will automatically place configuration files in this location. 
Sometimes, these configuration files can grow in size such that the Home directory approaches its storage quota limit. 
If this issue occurs, it is simple to move the configuration files from Home to Work and place a link in 
Home that points to the new location of the configuration files in Work.

For instance, Anaconda stores its configuration files in *~/.conda* by default, and this directory often grows to multiple GBs in size, consequently using a significant portion of the Home directory's allocated memory. 
The *~/.conda* directory can be moved to Work and can be replaced by a link in Home that points to the new location. 
This can be carried out with the following commands:

```
$ mv ~/.conda /storage/work/$(whoami)
$ ln -s /storage/work/$(whoami)/.conda ~/.conda
```


## Storage Allocations

A paid storage allocation provides access to a shareable group location for active file storage. 
Active group storage is included with a paid compute allocation, but additional storage space can be purchased separately as well. 
Active storage is mounted on all compute resources and enables users to read, write, and modify files stored there. 
For long-term storage of infrequently used files that is separate from compute resources, archive storage is available for purchase and is accessible via the [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) interface.

Typically, access to group storage locations can be managed using the `<owner>_collab` group where the `<owner>` is the user ID of the owner of the group space. 
For users to be added or removed from `<owner>_collab` groups, the owner of that group must submit a request to **icds@psu.edu**.


## User-Managed Groups

If the owner of a group space would like more control over the access groups or would like to designate a group coordinator, then it is recommended that the owner [create a User Managed Group (UMG)](https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011865&sys_kb_id=81102ada87cedd10d7bf7485dabb35b0&spa=1). 
The UMG allows a user to manage the group access list and group roles directly through the User Managed Group functionality through [Penn State Accounts Management](https://accounts.psu.edu/manage). 
Select the following options and adhere to the following recommendations when creating the UMG:

```
Group Function:     Functional
Campus:             University Park
Display Name:       icds.rc.<umg_name>
                    e.g. icds.rc.abc1234_collab
Email:              Not necessary for RC use
Security:           Sync with Enterprise Active Directory is required
```

ICDS filters UMGs for display names that begin with `icds.rc.`, so any UMGs created with this prefix will automatically appear within RC. 
It may take up to 15 minutes for a newly created UMG to appear on RC. 
To verify that a UMG is available on RC, run the following command on RC:

```
$ getent group icds.rc.<umg_name>
```

After a UMG is created, the owner can submit a request to **icds@psu.edu** to associate this UMG with the `<owner>_collab` group. 
Once the association between the UMG and the `<owner>_collab` group is made, then the group owner has full dynamic control over the access and roles of the `<owner>_collab` group by modifying the UMG membership. 
After this single request to ICDS, the owner no longer must submit requests to modify group membership and instead can manage the group directly. 
Note that any user added as a UMG member that *does not* have an active Roar account will not have access to Roar or any data on Roar until that user has an active Roar account.


## File Transfers

RC offers many file transfer options, and these methods are described in the following sections on this page.

To comply with restricted data storage standards, RR must adhere to a Secure Data Transfer Management Model. 
The data transfer process is described in detail in the [Roar Restricted Addendum](06_RoarRestricted.md).


### Globus

The recommended file transfer method for RC is [Globus](https://www.globus.org/), especially for files that are multiple GBs in size or larger. 
Also, if issues due to an unreliable connection arise, transferring via Globus may be a good option. 
Globus is a web-based file transfer tool that automates the activity of managing file transfers, such as monitoring performance, retrying failed transfers, recovering from faults automatically whenever possible, and reporting status.
With Globus, users can easily, reliably, and securely transfer data to and from RC.

Globus endpoints must be installed on both the source and destination systems. 
RC has Globus endpoints available.

```
RC Endpoint:
Penn State ICDS RC

RC Archive Endpoint:
Penn State ICDS Archive

OneDrive Endpoint:
Penn State ICDS OneDrive
```

To transfer files with Globus, visit the [Globus website](https://www.globus.org/) and log in as a Penn State user with your Penn State access account. 
Select the File Manager tab on the left side of the Globus web interface and select the source and destination endpoints. 
The endpoints may require an additional login. 
The files and locations for the transfer can be selected graphically, and the transfer can be initiated by selecting *Start* above the source endpoint file preview window. 
The transfer will be handled by Globus, and typically, successful completion of the transfer will generate an email to your Penn State email.

Users can also download files from RC to their local device or upload files directly from their local device to RC using simple web interface operations. 
To download a file, right-click the file and select Download. 
To upload a file, select Upload from the Pane 1 Menu on the right.

Globus provides detailed instructions on the following topics:
 
- [Log in and transfer files](https://docs.globus.org/guides/tutorials/manage-files/transfer-files/)
- [Install and configure Globus Connect for Linux](https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/install/linux/)
- [Install and configure Globus Connect for MacOSX](https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/install/mac/)
- [Install and configure Globus Connect for Windows](https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/install/windows/)


### RC Portal File Manager

The File Manager app on the RC Portal offers a very intuitive interface for file management. 
Files can be moved, edited, uploaded, and downloaded with relative ease using this utility. 
Users should limit the use of the RC Portal file manager utility to dealing with small files only.


### scp

Users may use the `scp` command to transfer files to and from RC. 
For small-scale file transfers to/from RC, the submit nodes (hostname **submit.hpc.psu.edu**) can be used. 
It is typically practical to zip files together when transferring many files at once. 
In a terminal session, the `scp` command can be used to transfer files in the following way:

```
$ scp [options] <source-user-id>@<source-host>[:<file-location>] <destination-user-id>@<destination-host>[:<file-location>]
```

Some examples will further clarify the usage of this command. 
The two locations in this example are the directory **/home/abc** on a local laptop device and the user scratch space on RC. 
If a file named *local.file* in **/home/abc** is to be transferred to a user's scratch space, the user should run the following command from a terminal session on the local laptop:

```
# Transfer to RC scratch space
$ scp /home/abc/local.file <userid>@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/scratch/<userid>
```

Alternatively, if the user navigates to the **/home/abc** location on their local laptop, the command can be slightly simplified to

```
# Transfer to RC scratch space
$ scp local.file <userid>@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/scratch/<userid>
```

If a directory named *datadir* located on the user's RC scratch space is to be transferred to the local laptop's **/home/abc** directory, the user can run the following from a terminal session on the local laptop:

```
# Transfer from RC scratch space
$ scp -r <userid>@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/scratch/<userid> /home/abc/
```

Note that since a directory is being transferred, the `-r` option must be used for the `scp` command so both the directory and its contents are transferred. 
If the user navigates the terminal to the **/home/abc** directory to conduct the transfer, then the **/home/abc/** in the above commands can be replaced with a single period **.** to denote the *current working directory*.

```
# Transfer from RC scratch space
$ scp -r <userid>@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/scratch/<userid> .
```


### sftp

The `sftp` command can also be used to transfer files and is more useful when transferring multiple smaller files in a piecemeal fashion. 
This method allows for interactive navigation on the remote connection. 
For small-scale file transfers to/from RC, the submit nodes (hostname **submit.hpc.psu.edu**) can be used. 
From a local device, an `sftp` connection can be made with

```
$ sftp <userid>@<remote-host>[:<location>]
```

To spawn an `sftp` connection on RC, use

```
$ sftp <userid>@submit.hpc.psu.edu
```

After the `sftp` connection is made, navigational commands (i.e. `ls`, `cd`, etc) are performed on the remote connection normally, while navigational commands are performed on the local connection by appending the letter **l** (lowercase L) to the commands (i.e. `lls`, `lcd`, etc). 
Files are transferred from the local device to the remote device using the `put <filename>` command, and files are transferred from the remote device to the local device using the `get <filename>` command. 
The connection is terminated with the `exit` command.


### rsync

Yet another file transfer option is `rsync`. 
The `rsync` tool is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use. 
The `rsync` command takes the form

```
$ rsync [options] <source-user-id>@<source-host>[:<file-location>] <destination-user-id>@<destination-host>[:<file-location>]
```

The `rsync` tool should only be used within an interactive compute session due to its underlying resource requirements.
